`**Lorem Ipsum** is simply dummy text of <strong>the printing and typesetting industry</strong>. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, <em>but also the leap into electronic</em>typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets <mark>containing Lorem Ipsum</mark>passages, and more recently with desktop <s>publishing software like</s> Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.`
